                                <p>The best time is right now, and here’s why...</p>
                                <p>We empower you to identify, cultivate, and utilize every opportunity around you to
                                    strengthen your case and enhance your eligibility, irrespective of whether you’re a
                                    professional or a student.</p>
                                <p>Delaying means missing out on opportunities. Moreover, the primary objective of this
                                    endeavor is to save time. The earlier you begin, the more time you’ll have to
                                    construct an impressive profile.</p>
                                <p>If you’re worried about the H-1B lottery, a robust profile like this can also aid in
                                    qualifying for the O-1A, which is merit-based and doesn’t rely on lottery luck.</p>
                                <p>If you’re already in the EB-2 or EB-3 process, this won’t interfere at all. In fact,
                                    you’ll be able to use the same priority date for the EB-1A, accelerating your green
                                    card acquisition.</p>
                                <p>Regarding location, you can be anywhere globally. Your significant work and the
                                    recognition you earn are what truly count. Many people apply for the EB-1A and O-1A
                                    from outside the US each year and relocate to the US under this status.</p>

                                    <p>The criteria for evidence for both EB-1A and O-1A are alike, but securing an O-1A
                                        doesn’t assure an EB-1A. It’s generally understood that the EB-1A demands a
                                        higher standard of proof compared to the O-1A.</p>
                                    <p>In essence, if you met the qualifications for the EB-1A, you would likely also
                                        qualify for the O-1A. This means you would have an alternative to the
                                        unpredictable H-1B lottery and wouldn’t be solely reliant on it.</p>
                                    <p>Moreover, the O-1 is a temporary visa, and you would eventually need to apply for
                                        the EB-1A Green Card. So, why not aim for the final goal, considering the O-1 as
                                        a stepping stone in the journey.</p>
